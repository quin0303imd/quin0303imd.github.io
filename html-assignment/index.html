            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Hugo Lawrence Quinlivan. I was born on the 4<sup>th</sup> of June, 2003 in Washington <abbr title="District of Columbia">D.C.</abbr>.  However, I have never actually lived in the <abbr title="United States of America">U.S.A</abbr>. At the young age of 0.5, my parents moved to Brussels, Belgium with me. I lived in belgium for 2 years before moving to Vienna, Austria to Beijing, China to Ottawa, Canada and lastly to Singapore. I graduated highschool in 2021 at Singapore American School. I have always been an aspiring musician for as long as I can remember. My earliest recollection of wanting to be a musician is when I lived in Vienna, in around second grade, I was obsessed with the song "Mr. Brightside" by The Killers so I asked my parents for an electric guitar so I could become a rockstar. Fast forward back to the present and I still have that exact guitar in my room, along with the fact I now play the guitar, drums, and piano and am an aspiring producer and vocalist.

                I have always been passionate about music but I also have many other passions. Mainly pertaining to <em>creation</em>. That may come in the form of writing, filming, and editing films with my friends for youtube, writing bad books and comics, trying to teach myself game development, learning how to animate in blender, making a ton of websites I never finish, and more. When I was around 13 years old I was diagnosed with severe<abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder">ADHD</abbr> and later in life,at 16, I was diagnosed with <abbr title="Obsessive Compulsive Disorder">OCD</abbr> These two neuropsychiatric dissabilities are a rare occurence due to the fact that they are very opposite in symptoms. Together they have been a very impactful (both negatively and positively) part of my life. I believe that the reason I am so passionate about music and generally creating things is, in-part, due to having these two neuropsychiatric dissabilities. My goal one day is to be an independent musician and be able to have full creative control of every part of my brand, for example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Creating and maintaining my own website</li>
                    <li>Making my own cover art and promotional material</li>
                    <li>directing, filming and editing my own music videos</li>
                    <li>crreating my own clothing line and merchandise</li>
                </ul>
                ... and so on. I also want to be able to create my own multi-media company for independent artists of all fields. As well as, provide my services for other aspiring creators. I also want to make all my closest friends and family successful in their fields of interest and be a spokesperson for helping other young people with neuropsychiatric dissabilities like <abbr title="Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder">ADHD</abbr> or <abbr title="Obsessive Compulsive Disorder">OCD</abbr>.
